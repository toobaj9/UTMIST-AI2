# # SUBMISSION: Agent
# This will be the Agent class we run in the 1v1. We've started you off with a functioning RL agent (`SB3Agent(Agent)`) and if-statement agent (`BasedAgent(Agent)`). Feel free to copy either to `SubmittedAgent(Agent)` then begin modifying.
# 
# Requirements:
# - Your submission **MUST** be of type `SubmittedAgent(Agent)`
# - Any instantiated classes **MUST** be defined within and below this code block.
# 
# Remember, your agent can be either machine learning, OR if-statement based. I've seen many successful agents arising purely from if-statements - give them a shot as well, if ML is too complicated at first!!
# 
# Also PLEASE ask us questions in the Discord server if any of the API is confusing. We'd be more than happy to clarify and get the team on the right track.
# Requirements:
# - **DO NOT** import any modules beyond the following code block. They will not be parsed and may cause your submission to fail validation.
# - Only write imports that have not been used above this code block
# - Only write imports that are from libraries listed here
# We're using PPO by default, but feel free to experiment with other Stable-Baselines 3 algorithms!
